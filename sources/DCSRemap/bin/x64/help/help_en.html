<h1>DCS Remap</h1>

<p>This software allows to perform defective pixels, rows and
columns remap for Kodak DCS cameras. Currently supported camera models are
Kodak DCS Proback 645 M/C/H, Kodak DCS 14n, 14nx, SLR/n and SLR/c. Out of all
the cameras extensive tests were done on various Probacks and 14nx and SLR/n
models, the rest should work but not extensively tested.</p>

<h2>A few concepts</h2>

<p>In Kodak cameras the sensor circuitry (here and further on
referred to as imager) has a special individual file that describes individual
characteristics of that imager. That file is written and stored inside an
internal camera memory pretty much the same as firmware but in separate non
user accessible area. It is not available openly to access from standard
firmware and user-level menus. All the cameras have however a special firmware
mode (called service mode from now on) where it can be accessed and modified
via menus. This service mode can be entered in a variety of ways (entering the
special key in DCS Camera Manager that is dependent on camera serial number and
so on). This software however comes with a special versions of firmware for
each camera model that enables that service mode permanently so it can be just
uploaded for the purpose of remap and then rolled back and replaced with
standard firmware again. The links to the service enabling firmware are below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The imager file contains the information about sensor
defects (points, columns and rows) and needs to be downloaded from the camera
for the remap, then updated with new remap and written back again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remap procedure for Kodak Proback 645 M/C/H:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Install the above service mode firmware (twice)
and use &quot;Save IF File&quot; menu to write imager file onto a flash card.
The file should be called TEST.IF</li>

<li>On Probacks generally the remap is better done
on dark frames (where people can see distinct defective columns when pulling
the shadows). To perform a remap a dark shot raw file is needed. I would
suggest a shot at a basic ISO with the closed lens cap at around 1/2 or 1/4
second. To improve stability of a remap, several dark shots can be made - the
DCS Remap software can stack up to 7 raw files in a median stack leaving only
stable defects in.</li>

<li>Backup the copy of the imager file (for safety)
and load imager file and raw file(s) in DCS Remap.</li>

<li>Columns remap: adjust the exposure in a raw
display tab to make the defects visible, switch on the column remapping and at
high magnification mark the defective columns with the mouse. I strongly
recommend using Composite or Grayscale raw display modes for manual remaps. </li>

<li>Probacks do not support (need) rows remap so all
rows related parts of remap in DCS Remap will be disabled.</li>

<li>Points remap: these can also be done manually
but it could be more effective to use auto remap with selected thresholds (more
details below in the application help).</li>

<li>Save the remap when satisfied, check the
resulting TEST.IF imager file is no larger than it was and upload it via flash
card into camera using &quot;Load IF File&quot; menu</li>

<li>Test the new remap with a few shots and when
satisfied, update firmware to the last production one (twice).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remap procedure for Kodak 14n/14nx, SLR/n, SLR/c:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install the above service mode firmware (twice)
and use hotkey to get to the service menu, choose &quot;Save IF File&quot; menu
to write imager file onto a flash card. The file should be called TEST.IF</li>

<li>
The next bit is complicated. These cameras do
have a loss compressed raw which can hide some defects. The DCS Remap software
will be able to handle .DCR files but may not be effective eliminating all the
defects. In service mode firmware fortunately, a true raw uncompressed format
can be chosen - it is referred to as .RCF files. I suggest that is used for the
remap if using .DCR was not effective enough. That file however comes without
any corrections so already remapped defects (those already recorded in imager
file) will also be visible. Unlike Proback, for SLR cameras I suggest shooting
pure white frame, uniformly lit (as much as possible) and with exposure close
to saturation point (raw values below 3700 roughly uniform around the frame).
If using the lens, make sure it is defocused and is at f/4 or f/5.6. Multiple raw
of the same type can be stacked in median stack to improve stability of the
defect appearance.</li>

<li>
Backup the copy of the imager file (for safety)
and load imager file and raw file(s) in DCS Remap.</li>

<li>
Rows/Columns remap: adjust the exposure in a raw
display tab to make the defects visible, switch on the column remapping and at
high magnification mark the defective columns with the mouse. I strongly
recommend using Composite or Grayscale raw display modes for manual remaps.</li>

<li>
Points remap: these can also be done manually
but it could be more effective to use auto remap with selected thresholds (more
details below in the application help). If the uniform lit frame is difficult
to achieve (and especially when using .RCF uncorrected raw files), I would
strongly recommend using adaptive auto remap (see below for detailed
description of how it works).</li>

<li>
Save the remap when satisfied, check the
resulting TEST.IF imager file is no larger than it was and upload it via flash
card into camera using &quot;Load IF File&quot; menu</li>

<li>
Test the new remap with a few shots and when
satisfied, update firmware to the last production one (twice).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course the above are only recommended procedures. You can
use manual remaps with just about anything (if the defects can be clearly
seen). The automatic remap of defective points however will only work if the
raw shot is uniform (i.e. roughly all of the same level - all dark or all grey
or all white etc.).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="features">The DCS Remap application features</h2>

<p>The application functionality and controls is divided into two
functional areas: one that has to do with raw file appearance and another that
has to do with remap of defects. This can be seen on the two separate tabs to
the left holding all the user interface for each of those areas in separate
tab.</p>

<p>All the menus (except help) are duplicated with buttons on
the right side of the main window so I won't describe what they do here
separately.</p>

<p>Most of the user interface elements have appropriate
tooltips to make it easier to remember the functionality.</p>

<h3>Main window view</h3>
</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page0_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>Toolbar contains buttons that control zoom levels (100%, Fit
to Window, Zoom in, Zoom level selection and Zoom out), manual defect mode
selector buttons (columns remap, points remap and rows remap) and interface
language selection buttons (English and Russian). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fit to Window zoom level is a bit different from commonly
accepted. When selected, it will pick the largest zoom (from available list in
drop down) with which the raw file will fit into window. It will also change it when resizing. The reason it is
done this way is that with specifics of raw display only the selected list of
zooms allow to do it effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remap mode buttons are all mutually exclusive and will
switch on the appropriate remap mode when the columns, points or rows may be
selected with mouse cursor and either set or reset as defective. The selected
mode has to correspond to defects selection so it will be synchronised with
those settings. Proback does not allow rows remap so no row remap mode or row
defects selection are available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Status bar</h4>

<p>This is used to display some dynamic statistics - the row
and column under mouse cursor, the R,G,B,G2 raw channel values for pixel under
mouse cursor (if raw file is loaded) and the total counts of currently remapped
defects for columns, points and rows. The total defects count is affected by
the defects selection settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Common buttons section</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Load IF file</h4>

<p>Loads and displays imager file defects. If the raw file has
been already loaded and does not match the imager, a message is presented
allowing to choose what to do (load imager and discard the raw or cancel imager
file loading).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Load RAW(s)</h4>

<p>Loads and displays single of multiple raw files. If the
imager file has been already loaded and does not match the raw, a message is
presented allowing to choose what to do (load raw(s) and discard the imager
file or cancel raw file loading). If multiple raw files are selected (up to 7),
they all stacked into single raw file using median stack (to reduce noise and
eliminate non stable defects).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Save remap</h4>

<p>Saves the remapped defects back to imager file. This imager
file is then ready to be uploaded to the camera. After successful saving the
imager file is reloaded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reset</h4>

<p>Resets all remapped defects in this session and reloads
imager file. This effectively performs a roll back of all the changes to what
was the last saved or loaded imager file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="defects">Main window (Defects page)</h3>

<p>This page will become enabled when imager file is loaded.
The full list if its settings and user interface elements is described in the
following sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page0_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<h4>ISO</h4>

<p>This drop down allow selecting the ISO for the remap. The
ISOs in a drop down list for which there are already defects defined will be
indicated by checkbox against them. This affects both selection of defects for
display and the remap being performed. In Kodak's remapped defects recorded
with specific ISO are applicable (and will be remapped by camera) when a shot
is performed at that ISO or above it. As such generally applicable defects
(i.e. for any ISO) should be recorded at smallest ISO (ISO 6 in Kodaks).
Majority of defects in Kodak imager files are recorder against that basic ISO.
The selection of the ISO follows the same logic - it displays all the defects
that can be remapped at this ISO. This selection also affects the defects count
displayed in status line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remove selected defects</h4>

<p>This button will delete all the defects selected by ISO and
defects selection checkboxes form imager file (even those existing there
before). This may be useful to start from fresh remap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Defects Colour</h4>

<p>This button allows to pick the colours for displaying
defects. The defects are always displayed on top of the raw file but this
setting may come useful in different type of images (dark, light etc.) where a
specific colour may be obscured by raw file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Defects selection</h4>

<p>This block of checkboxes allows to select what defects are
currently displayed and being remapped. Deselecting the type of defects
currently being remapped will also disable the remap mode (buttons in toolbar).
The selection affects the defects count
displayed in status line. The selection of Existing pre-remap defects is needed
to allow only view newly remapped defects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Auto remap defect thresholds</h4>

<p>These define per channel thresholds used for defective
points auto remap. The standard auto remap is performed by comparing the pixel
values from the raw file to the calculated average value for the channel and
marking it as defective if selected threshold is exceeded. If adaptive remap is
selected, then the raw values are compared to a median value for the channel
calculated within a block of pixels of selected size and marking it as
defective if threshold for that channel is exceeded. The average standard remap
works good for uniform shots (dark shots from Proback remap). The adaptive
remaps work best for uncorrected .RCF files or where uniform raw file cannot be
produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Adaptive remap</h4>
<p>Enables adaptive auto remap. Selecting this enables block
size drop down for adaptive remap as well. Adaptive remap will look at the
image blocks of the indicated size and calculate median values for all channels
for each block. The remap is then performed by comparing the raw values in the
block against the medians to see if they are exceeding per-channels thresholds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Block size</h4>

<p>This drop down allows selecting the block size (in pixels)
for adaptive remap. The blocks have an even size and range from 4x4 to 64x64.
Larger blocks will be less localised where the bigger sample may mean more
accurate median. Smaller blocks are nevertheless effective for remap of
standalone pixels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Detect from RAW</h4>

<p>Selecting this button attempts to default (or re-default)
thresholds from loaded raw file. It will only work for uniform 
black and uniform white shots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Auto remap</h4>

<p>Pressing this button will perform standard or adaptive
points auto remap according to the selected parameters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Currently loaded RAW statistics</h4>

<p>This shows statistics for loaded raw file channels - min,
max and average values and the count of defects found that would be auto remapped
with the current settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="raw_display">Main window (RAW Display page)</h3>

<p>This page will become enabled when raw file(s) are loaded.
The full list if its settings and user interface elements is described in the
following sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="page1_en.jpg"></p>
</div>
<div class="content">

<p>The first group of control provides 3 options that affect
how the raw file is displayed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>RGB Render</h4>

<p>When selected the raw file is displayed using RGB rendering
for each pixel. The missing colours are taken from neighbouring pixels in 2x2
pixel block thus making this effectively display large 2x2 pixels (each 2x2
RGBG2 block ends up being of the same colour). It is very convenient to spot
colour differences in pixels but not very useful for remap - since every defect
will show up as 2x2 block. For manual remap, I'd recommend to use it to spot
defects and then witch to one of the other two methods to actually remap
defects. Status bar in this mode shows the RGBG2 values for 2x2 block not the
pixel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Composite</h4>

<p>When selected the raw file is displayed using the pixel
colour only. For Red the pixel will be red, for Green/Green2 it will be green
and for Blue it will be blue. With all channels selected that may make defects
more difficult to spot so this is good for remapping itself not for searching
for defects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Grayscale</h4>

<p>It is essentially the same as composite but each pixel has
all 3 components (R, G and B) set to the underlying pixel value. It is basically
a composite mode displayed in grayscale. It is a compromise between Composite
and RGB Render and can be used for looking for defects as well as remapping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Channel selection</h4>

<p>These set of checkboxes allows to pick the raw channels to
be displayed. The deselected channels are simply rendered black. The channels
layout follow the Bayer pattern so columns and rows match those on a sensor
(for easier de-selection of the even/odd rows and columns).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Gamma 2.2</h4>

<p>This enables gamma 2.2 correction applied to raw data and
improves the display of the raw files (and a need to apply large exposure
correction).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black level zeroed</h4>

<p>This switches on a different method of applying black level.
When selected the black levels are simply zeroed. I.e. each value up to
selected black level in a channel is set to 0. When it is not selected, black
levels calculated by traditional subtraction. This could be useful for spotting
faint defective columns in dark frames for Proback and is enabled by default.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>WB (from RAW)</h4>

<p>This button sets all per-channel exposure boost settings to
white balance multipliers extracted from raw file (if none is specified, it
uses daylight ones provided by LibRaw). This is absolutely useless for remap
but good to have a for playing with the raw files and analysing post remapped raw
(to make them look more natural).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reset Corrections</h4>

<p>Resets all exposure, contrast and black level corrections
when pressed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Exposure Corrections</h4>

<p>This set of sliders and values controls exposure
corrections. The values for these are indicated in stops and cover the range
from -5 to +5 stops. The number values have more precision than sliders but
setting the exposure with sliders is faster. The exposure correction can be
done at individual channel levels and overall. These controls should be used to
bring up the dark raw areas in Proback remap to a visible range and make a
defects in certain channels more prominent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contrast</h4>

<p>This section has two contrast related sliders. The Contrast
slider controls level of contrast boost applied (steepness of the slope of
S-curve). The Midpoint slider controls the middle point of contrast S curve.
These controls should be used to make defect more prominent (and are quite
useful for Proback dark frame remaps).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black levels</h4>

<p>These control set the black levels for each channel. They
can be used to cut out the noise when boosting exposure on dark raw files. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Corrections order</h4>

<p>All the corrections are applied to the raw data in this
order: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
black levels -&gt; gamma -&gt; exposure correction -&gt; contrast.</p>
